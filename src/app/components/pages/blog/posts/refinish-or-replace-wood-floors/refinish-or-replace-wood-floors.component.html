        <p>Just Floored, LLC faces the question of whether to refinish existing hardwood floors or replacing hardwood floors from homeowners and business owners every day. It is true you can save money by just refinishing the hardwood floors on site, it is not always possible or cost effective.</p>
        <p>We recently were called out to a home in Cumming, Georgia to evaluate the existing floors and give a free in home quote. The house was an older home and the floors were in terrible shape. There were many places that were gouged and many cracks. The homeowner wanted to add new floors on the entire main floor to match the older, existing oak wood floors. And the kitchen had recently been redone and was missing flooring in many places.</p>
        <p>We could have tried to patch in new floors, fix the bad floors and resand and restain all the flooring, sealing the hardwood floors when we finished. And in many instances we can do just that. But these particular floors were in such bad shape that it would have cost more than installing new floors. Also, the wood was oak and the client decided she wanted to go with cherry wood instead, helping answer the question of refinishing or replacing the floors.</p>
        <p>Our Just Floored craftsman came in and removed the existing hardwoods and quickly installed the new cherry floors. We then finished them on site by staining them with a nice cherry stain and applying 3 coats of poly. The customer is thrilled with the updated look of her new hardwood floors. Her Cumming, Georgia home will see a bump in equity value as well.</p>
        <p>Just Floored is the right expert to call to install any type of wood floor. We install hardwood floors, prefinished or unfinished, engineered wood floors, bamboo, cork, hand scraped, vinyl, stone or tile. And we don't just do floors, we can install tile or stone back splashes or wainscoting in your kitchen or bath. Consider a custom pattern for the install, it will really jazz up the look. Even plain white subway tile takes on a design level by doing a brick pattern coupled with a basket weave pattern and separated with a tile border or liner.</p>
        <p>Just Floored services all of the Atlanta area including suburbs such as Vinings, Sugar Hill, Alpharetta, Dacula, Johns Creek, Kennesaw, Sandy Springs, Roswell and Braselton to name a few. We also service Jacksonville, Florida and Houston, Texas. Contact us today for a free, no obligation quote.</p>
