        <h3 class="h4 g-color-black g-font-weight-600">Water Based Finishes vs Oil Based Finishes</h3>
        <p>Many customers want to know what is the difference between water based <strong>polyurethane products</strong> and oil based. They both will protect your newly installed <strong>wood floors</strong> or newly <strong>refinished floors</strong>, for many years and provide a beautiful finish. But there are differences that can help clients choose the best choice for themselves when deciding on the coating. Here are a few of the differences:</p>
        <h4 class="h6 g-color-black g-font-weight-600">Oil Based Coatings</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Coatings can only be applied once or twice in a single day</li>

        </ul>
        <h4 class="h6 g-color-black g-font-weight-600">Water Based Coatings</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Less Odor than oil based</li>
          <li>Dries faster that oil based</li>

          <li>Clear coating doesn't age</li>
          <li>Needs three coats</li>
          <li>More expensive than oil based</li>
          <li>Scratches easier than oil based</li>

        <h3 class="h4 g-color-black g-font-weight-600">Why Choose Monocoat Products?</h3>
        <p>Just Floored LLC has been offering <strong>new flooring installations</strong> coated with Monocoat products or <strong>dustless floor refinishing</strong> with Monocoat coatings for years due to the high quality of the coatings. Monocoat offers a <strong>floor finish</strong> that is plant based and all natural.

        <p>Choices for <strong>wood floor finishes</strong> include a clear coat as well as 25 different color finishes. Monocoat finishes only need one coat and require less maintenance than other products. It attaches to the wood at the molecular level whereas <strong>polyurethane finishes</strong> seal the wood instead. Monocoat finishes work best on woods such as oak flooring, whereas bamboo or other tightly grained, oily woods, or really old flooring, are better suited to polyurethane products.</p>
